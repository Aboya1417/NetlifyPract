1. Background story: 
Palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads backwards as forwards.

e.g madam, nurses run, Anna, Civic, Level, Noon, mom, refer.

Each word is the same as the reverse of it.
Question:
write a function called Palindromechecker that takes in an array input  and return true if any word
in the input array is a Palindrome;

Hint: an helper function has been given to you called reverseString.
reverseString is a function that helps you to reverse a word. 

e.g reverseString("bag") =  "gab"; // not a Palindrome 
    reverseString("refer") =  "refer"; // it is a Palindrome

2. Background Story:

   A car is a four-wheeled road vehicle that is powered by an engine and
   is able to carry a small number of people.
   it has the following properties: 2 doors, 4 tryres, 2 rearSeats,
   1 windshield, 2 sideMirrors.

  Question:
   i. Create an object called car to describe the car described above (10 marks)
   
   ii. write a function called carSideMirrorChecker that take in a car object you created in i above
      and return the number of rearSeats of the car object; (10 marks)
   
 
3.Background story:
	
  In mathematices average is the addition of  all the numbers in a group and
  then divided by the number of numbers.

  E.g let numArray = [4,8,20,80,75,40];
       let sumOfnumArray  = 4 + 8 + 20 + 80 + 75 + 50 = 227;
	the number of items in a = 6;
	hense average of numArray  =    sumOfnumArray/ 6 (227 / 7)

	Question:
	write a function called average which takes an an array of integers and return its average;
